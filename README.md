Project Name: Code Comparison Tool

Description:
The Code Comparison Tool is a utility designed to analyze and compare codebases. It provides functionality to compare files, check naming conventions, verify coding style adherence, and identify similarities and differences between two projects. The tool aims to assist developers in code analysis, collaboration, and identifying code reusability.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Customize the project directories in the `compare_code()` function of the `kimpa_str.py` file.
5. Run the any script  using Python: `python <namescript>.py`.
6. Run the script `kimpa_str.py` using Python: `python kimpa_str.py`.
7. The tool will compare the code in the specified project directories and provide detailed comparisons and analysis for each file.
8. Review the output in the console to identify similarities, differences, and other relevant information.
9. Customize or extend the tool based on your specific requirements.

Note: Please make sure to provide appropriate file paths and encoding if your code files have different settings.
